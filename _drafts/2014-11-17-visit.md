I'm spending the first half of this week back in WA to deal with some not-fun 
personal stuff. You know, the kind that leave you curled up in the fetal position
muttering Excel formulas. (Actually, I try to avoid using Excel if possible. 
Use R instead.) <br><br>

<h2>An enforced vacation?</h2>

So it looks like there's a half day between when the cheapest flight gets in and 
when I have to be at any specific spot at a given time. <i>This is just the universe
telling me to take the opportunity for a spontaneous vacation</i>. Just me and 
Mom, some old-fashioned girl bonding.
