I'm spending the first half of this week back in WA to deal with some not-fun 
personal stuff. You know, the kind that leave you curled up in the fetal position
muttering Excel formulas. (Actually, I try to avoid using Excel if possible. 
Use R instead.) <br><br>

<h2>An enforced vacation?</h2>

So it looks like there's a half day between when the cheapest flight gets in and 
when I have to be at any specific spot at a given time. <i>This is just the universe
telling me to take the opportunity for a spontaneous vacation</i>. Just me and 
Mom, some old-fashioned girl bonding.

<h2>Food</h2>

We slurped noodles at my favorite Pho place (a cheap little dive near where I used 
to work). I got to try Korean BBQ for the first time in Federal Way (nom!). Found
a new favorite cafe for western style breakfast (pastries and coffee with a view! 
woot!). Indulged a craving for <i>dim sum</i>, and even got all fancy-schmancy 
one dinner (overrated food, terrific location, reasonable prices).

<h2>Water!Water!</h2>

The funny thing is, when I lived in WA, I rarely saw the water. Unless you count 
from the bus or freeway (or both). Now that I live in a landlocked state, I <i>
crave</i> water locations.
