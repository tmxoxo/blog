The quiet ones are what you have to watch out for, right? <br><br>

And eggs certainly fall into that category, whether lined up tidily in cartons
at the grocery or on a counter ready to incorporate into batter for pancakes/cookies/cakes/custards/etc. Innocuous but oh-so-tasty.<br><br>


For everyday meals I prefer simple & easy: boiled, poached, or steamed. Given the 
frequency with which we eat eggs (a cheap and low-cal protein source), this 
cooking method can get boring week after week. <br><br>

<b>disclaimer</b>: <i>the methods below discuss preservation of eggs in a solution 
of high salinity and/or high acidity. failure to sanitize appropriately, achieve the necessary salinity/acidity levels and/or food storage at room temperatures increases the risk of infection by the botulinum toxin (botulism), which is a life-threatening condition.</i><br><br>

Was that warning dire enough? Are you still interested? Well, read on <br><br>

Today I'm going to talk about preserving eggs using a high salinity method. It's 
an easy way of infusing a lot of flavor into the eggs using minimal ingredients.
It's also a technique that I've only come across in Asian and Pacific Islander
cuisine, although I am more than happy to be corrected.<br><br>

While traditionally, these are made with duck eggs, chicken eggs work just fine.<br><br>

INGREDIENTS:<br>

<ul>
<li>1 dozen eggs</li>
<li>4 cups water</li>
<li>1 cup salt</li>
<li>1 quart screw top jar</li>
</ul>

METHOD:<br>

<ol>
<li>Prepare your jar. We are not canning here, so our goal is cleanliness without the need for an air-tight seal - feel free to reuse old jars! I like to run any container that
has been sitting on our shelves through a heated rinse/dry in my dishwasher.</li>
<li>Dissolve the salt in water (1:4 by volume) and bring to a rolling boil. Let it cool.</li>
<li>While the brining solution is cooling, clean your eggs by rinsing in cool water 
and drain. Set aside any eggs with imperfections - cracks are bad!</li>
<li>Add the (whole) eggs to your prepared jar.</li>
<li>Pour the brine solution over the eggs and attach the lid loosely. The eggs 
should be completely submerged.</li>
<li>Store in a dark, cool place for 4-6 weeks. I keep mine under the stairs in my 
basement.</li>
<li>At the four week mark, retrieve one egg, rinse and cook (remember! raw eggs!). The
eggs are ready when they have reached desired saltiness and the cooked yolks are 
bright orange-red. For saltier eggs, simply leave the egg to brine for a little 
longer.</li>
<li>When your eggs are ready, rinse off the brine solution for remaining eggs 
and transfer to a container in your fridge.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Okay, now what?</h2>

My favorite way to cook up salted eggs is to steam them in a rice cooker with 
some chinese sausage. The salt from the egg is a nice contrast to cut through
the sausage fat and adds dimension to plain white rice. <br><br>

My mom will use the yolks from boiled salted eggs to create a custard to dip 
sweet bread into. Technically, you're supposed to fill the rolls with the custard,
but separting the two is less technique-driven. <i>And just as tasty!</i>

<h2>Yikes, they are way too salty</h2>

When I made these for Ted the first time, he found them <i>too</i> salty. After
all, they look basically like regular boiled eggs, so it was an unexpected flavor.
What worked for us was to poach them in a light broth with some vegetables and 
wontons. The saltiness from the egg acted to season both the soup and the veggies.

<h2>Variations and usage</h2>
Adding spices will infuse the eggs with subtle flavors. Peppercorns and star 
anise are a popular combination - use whole, not powdered anise. Plain salted eggs 
may be used in both savory and sweet recipes. Just remember that salted eggs are
still raw, and should be stored in the refrigerator or a cool, dark location. 
To extend their shelf life, like fresh eggs, coat in mineral oil (flip the carton over monthly).
