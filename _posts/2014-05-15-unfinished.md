## {{page.title}}

<div id = "blockcontent">
I swear that I must be the world's slowest remodler. Seriously, people build houses
(and stage them for sale) faster than I can get a single room done. And frankly,
after 5 years of work, there still isn't a single room that is completely "done". I don't think there ever will be.  

The todo list for the kitchen/eating area is:

<ol>
<li>Patch and paint the cabinets</li>
<li>Install crown molding and panel molding</li>
<li>Add a countertop outlet</li>
<li>Finish patching/painting the ceiling</li>
<li>Finish patching/painting the den doorway</li>
<li>Replace both the garage and basement doors</li>
<li>Patch and paint from the door replacement</li>
<li>Fabricate a countertop*</li>
<li>Install a backsplash</li>
<li>Curtains for above the sink and in the eating area</li>
<li>New cord cover for the lamp</li>
</ol>

Oh, and the floor, baseboards and hvac registers will be replaced (all at once thru the  entire house). <br><br>

easy-peasy, right? <br><br>

*I'm debating between DIY Ardex countertops (concrete-look) and butcher block. 
Ardex will cost ~ 1/3 butcher block which is about 1/2 cost of laminate. Of course 
I want to try a "test" project before I commit to Ardex....
