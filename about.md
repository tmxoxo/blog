<h2>Well hi! Hello there</h2>

<div id = "blockcontent">
It's nice to meet you. We're Ted and Marie, two almost-newlyweds currently living
with our dogs, Jayne (aka "First Pup") and Nandi (aka "Princess"), in the midwest. Mostly this site is a journal of building our lives together. <br><br>

To our family and close friends reading along: <b>big hugs</b>. We love you 
lots!
